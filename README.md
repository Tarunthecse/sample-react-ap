# sample-react-ap

## How to run the project

In the project directory, you need to run:

### `npm install`

Then you need to run:

### `npm start`

Below are the screenshot of UI, which you will see. Here we have 3 buttons i.e Push, Pop & Peek.

Internally they will be calling the Api's from docker image. So please clone the java code from `https://github.com/Tarunthecse/stack-implementation-in-java` and run the docker image. For now endpoints are hardcoded.
